## Abstract

Machine learning (ML) training data is often scat-
tered across disparate collections of datasets, called data silos.
This fragmentation poses a major challenge for data-intensive
ML applications: integrating and transforming data residing
in different sources demand a lot of manual work and com-
putational resources. With data privacy constraints, data often
cannot leave the premises of data silos; hence model training
should proceed in a decentralized manner. In this work, we
present a vision of bridging traditional data integration (DI)
techniques with the requirements of modern machine learn-
ing systems. We explore the possibilities of utilizing metadata
obtained from data integration processes for improving the
effectiveness, efficiency, and privacy of ML models. Towards
this direction, we analyze ML training and inference over data
silos. Bringing data integration and machine learning together, we
highlight new research opportunities from the aspects of systems,
representations, factorized learning, and federated learning
